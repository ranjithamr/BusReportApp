* Since there is no requirement specifiying the facts to decide the Status,
    I have made the following assumptions comparing json data and the image -
    1. Bus is "Late", if the deviation is greater than 220.
    2. Bus is "On time", if the devation is between 0 and 220.
    3. Bus is "Early", if the devation is less than 0.
    4. Status is "Unknown, if the deviation is unkown.

* Since there is no endpoint provided for notes submission,
    I am saving the notes in localStorage for that particular organisation
    and this is retrieved on initialisation to show on the report.
